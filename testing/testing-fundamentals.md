# Fundamentals of testing

Developers shouldm test a variety of use cases and interactions as iteratively developing an app.

### Organize code for testing

The cycle of the TDD is the next:

    1. Writing a new test (or new cases in some methodologies)
    2. Write the necessary code to make the past test pass
    3. Do a refactor

After this cycle, the next step is to follow the UI-driven cycle.

### Viewing the app as a serie of modules

A module-base app is easier to test.
