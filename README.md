# Android Associated Developer Personal Guide

This repo contains my personal notes I wrote while preparing myself for the [Associate Android Developer](https://developers.google.com/certification/associate-android-developer?fbclid=IwAR0hNngDKsDQF5eJX6W2kXdpUiSbP6PEOJ0I9jSdIMlsi08IbisHvhRJpLA#requirements) exam (Kotlin edition).

Fortunately, this exam comes with a [very useful guide](https://developers.google.com/certification/associate-android-developer/study-guide/), which consists in 5 main areas:

    1. Android Core
    2. User Interface
    3. Data Management
    4. Debugging
    5. Testing

For every main topic, I'll create a main branch (e.g. main-topic/<topic-name>). That branch will assume the role of `develop` branch for that topic. The subtopics will have a role of subtopics, and its content will be merged in its main branch via PR. 

Hope this notes will be useful to anyone who finds it.

Happy coding!
